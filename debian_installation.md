xwax has been packaged for Debian and is available from the main Debian package repositories in the Wheezy release, but is out of date (xwax 0.9-2). If you are running the testing branch (Jessie), you can execute the following command to install xwax 1.4 and all its dependencies.

```
$ sudo apt-get install xwax
````

Alternatively you can use a graphical package manager such as synaptic.

*Note: the xwax_scan and xwax_import scripts are located under /usr/lib/xwax should you wish to replace them with customized versions.*
