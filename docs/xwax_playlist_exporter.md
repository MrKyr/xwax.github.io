[xwax Playlist Exporter](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/?content=128373) is Amarok 2 script that exports your current Amarok playlist to a file that can be read by xwax.

xwax default library scanner (/usr/libexec/xwax-scan) normally assumes that it's argument is a directory, but can be easily modified to recongise files (and simply echo them), or you can use /bin/cat as a scanner. (-s /bin/can xwax option)
